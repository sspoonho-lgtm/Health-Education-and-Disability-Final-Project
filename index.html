        <h1>Health Education and Disability</h1>
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        <p>This project looks into the distribution of disability prevalence across the United States, along with an analysis of school health policy priorities. Our two data sets, linked below, show variations and concentrations of disability and health policy data across the United States based on geography and social factors. Our data and insights can be used by Federal or State Health Departments, or Non-Profit Disability Advocacy Groups to prioritize specific services to regions  with the greatest need, such as those with high Mobility or Cognitive disability prevalence.

        <p>• Another insight is that Southern, rural areas generally have higher disability prevalence than urban areas due to barriers like transportation problems and lower socioeconomic position, especially as HHS Region 4 that contains the states Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee have the highest prevalence for disabilities overall.
</p>
        <p>• Comparing the data of the grouped bar chart and the Health and Human Services HHS Regional Offices map also shows that Northern, rural areas seem to have less prevalence of disability overall. Interestingly, however, HHS Region 1 that has similar disability prevalence to those of Northern, rural regions has about the same prevalence while also being more urban.

</p>
        <p>• All disability categories listed in the data are at an all time high in prevalence for HHS Region 4 compared to all other regions; all disabilities are at an all time low in prevalence for HHS Region 8 compared to all other regions. The reasons for these two could be due to over-reporting and underreporting, the different amounts in population for each region's states, and historical contexts or background of the states for each region.

        <p>• As percentages show the percentage of a population and not the total population, it is still interesting to see that the District of Columbia has a higher percentage ratio of both physical and mental disabilities, which could make sense regarding possible diversity and stress surrounding DC.</p>
        <p>• In terms of actual states, Washington state has the least percentages of mental and physical disabilities compared to all other states. Looking into Washington state could reveal more information about why there might be less people in the state with disabilities due to environment and background.
</p>
        <p>• With taking the percent averages for vision, hearing, and mobility combined as physical disabilities and taking the percent averages for self-care, cognitive, and independent living combined as mental disabilities, it is interesting to see that there is a higher average of physical disabilities than mental disabilities. The difference in averages of physical disabilities and mental  disabilities could be due to how averages were calculated, or by how surveys to attain information were conducted.

        <p>• Looking at the distributions, surveys for disability show the most frequent percentage of White respondents that had a disability was 3%-3.9%. A high frequency of a low percentage for disability means across states, people of White ethnicity usually had a minority amount of people who had a disability.
</p>
        <p>• People of Asian ethnicity had the least amount of distribution overall, with the most frequent disability percentage of Asian ethnicity as %4-%4.9. The low distribution compared to other ethnicities could indicate either a small population of Asian survey participants, or that surveys have possibly under-reported people of Asian background.
</p>
        <p>• Hispanic and Black ethnicities have a somewhat similar distribution for percentages of disabilities, where the most frequent reported percentage is 8%-8.9% for the Hispanic ethnicity and 7%-7.9% for the Black ethnicity - a one percent difference. The similar distributions could indicate possible similarities between Black and Hispanic ethnicities regarding history, prevalence, and background for disabilities.

        <p>• The largest category of policies is for Health Education, which is 36% of the total, followed by professional development and preperation. This suggests that the majority of U.S. school health policy focus is placed on activities or programs that promote student health and a healthy school enviornment, alongside preparing students for their future jobs and the work force.
</p>
        <p>• Surprisingly, the category of Before and After School Programs is low, at only 0.89 percent. This may be due to the fact that instructional time for tested core subjects is a higher priority for teachers in schools, rather than providing a lot of assistance to activities outside of school hours. This puts mroe responsibility on working parents or families, where they are at work before/after school and cannot come to pick up or drop off their children at the normal time. 
</p>
        <p>• States with a low policy distribution across key areas can use this national data to identify where they need to focus more on. By observing the areas where they fall behind, educational departments can prioritize putting more time into those smaller percentage areas. </p>

        <p>• One insight into this data is that the map shows that Health Education (Green) is the most common health topic across the majority of the US states. This shows a nationwide focus on educational policies related to health, and also shows that schools, for the majority, are all on the same page when it comes to educational health policies.
</p>
        <p>• Another insight into this visualization is that there are three states that have prioritized a healthy and safe school environment over health education. This may be due to the fact that the schools have deemed health education to be not as impirtant, or have prioritized keeping a safe a violence or bullying-free school enviornment more than other states.
</p>
        <p>• A key point to note here is that many states, including high population ones such as florida, do not ahve any collected data. This insight can be used to prioritize school evaluation in these states, and capture more data so that we can have insights into every U.S. state.</p>

        <p>• Firstly, the map reveals distinct regional concentrations for mobility disability (dark purple), and cognative disability (light red). This may be due to the fact that aging populations or chronic conditions may be higher in these areas, as they lead to disability as the person ages. 
</p>
        <p>• Another insight is there are only two states whose most prevelant disability is an independant living disability. This suggests that the barriers to independent living, which include difficulty doing errands, shopping, or visiting the doctor alone, are failing with community support in these states.
</p>
        <p>• From reigonal patterns seen in this data, we can use this to provide more support for each disability area. If disabilities are loosely grouped around by state, it is easier for reigons of the US to work together to provide more targeted care for these people.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        <p>             One key takeaway from this project is that the disability analysis highlighted strong regional concentrations of Mobility and Cognitive disabilities, particularly in certain HHS regions and rural areas, which calls fot a specific and localized approach to support services. Additionally, our review of school health policies found a focus on Health Education, reflected in both the pie chart and choropleth, suggesting an effort to keep students healthy and make them aware of bodiy health. However, this focus is contrasted by the considerable amount of missing data across several states, representing major gaps in policy effectiveness and data gathering. The primary audiences who can use this insight include Federal Agencies, State and Local Education Departmentsor Non-Profit Disability Advocacy Groups, which can which can use the data for grants and funding, or better target their services to communities with specific disability concentrations.
